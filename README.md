# Project Overview
FidelityWebDriver is a wrapper around the Selenium WebDriver, used to perform semantic driving of the Fidelity website.

Current build status: ![Build Status](http://sonnevillej.ddns.net:9000/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:FidelityWebDriver_Build)/statusIcon)

Much of the demo app and library is still not functional, but login capability has been implemented. While I'm still building out the structure of the library, I am planning on accept pull requests in the future.

## Usage
_This project depends on ChromeDriver, so be sure you have Chrome installed!_

Run the demo app with --help to see all command line arguments. The demo app will use the specified credentials to log into the www.Fidelity.com website, pause, and exit.
